üõ°Ô∏è Key Security Concepts
1. Threat

A threat is any potential danger that can exploit a weakness and cause harm to an information system.

Threats can be intentional (e.g., hackers, malware) or unintentional (e.g., power failure, human error).

Examples:

Hackers attempting unauthorized access

Malware spreading through networks

Flood or fire damaging data centers

2. Weakness

A weakness is a flaw or limitation in a system‚Äôs design, implementation, or configuration that may lead to security issues.

Not all weaknesses are exploitable, but they increase risk.

Examples:

Poor password policy

Unsecured open ports

Lack of encryption in data transmission

3. Vulnerability

A vulnerability is a specific weakness that can be exploited by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access or cause damage.

It is often documented in vulnerability databases such as CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

Examples:

SQL Injection in a website

Unpatched operating system bug

Buffer overflow in application code

4. Exploit

An exploit is a piece of code, command, or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability to compromise a system.

Exploits are often used in penetration testing and malicious attacks.

Examples:

Metasploit module targeting a CVE

Malware using a buffer overflow exploit

Phishing link exploiting browser vulnerabilities

5. Payload

A payload is the malicious part of an exploit that executes after the vulnerability is exploited.

It carries out the attacker‚Äôs intended action, such as data theft, damage, or control takeover.

Examples:

Ransomware encrypting system files

Trojan installing a backdoor

Spyware stealing sensitive information

| Concept           | Description                         | Example                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Threat**        | Potential danger or attack source   | Hacker, malware           |
| **Weakness**      | Flaw or gap that reduces security   | Poor password             |
| **Vulnerability** | Exploitable weakness                | Unpatched software        |
| **Exploit**       | Method to use the vulnerability     | Code or tool that attacks |
| **Payload**       | Malicious action after exploitation | Ransomware or keylogger   |
